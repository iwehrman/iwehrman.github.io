&ldquo;Traditionally the Fool represents the somehow mysteriously
structured chaos which seems to lie at the root of existence. In most
decks he is generally left unnumbered, or
counted a <a
href="http://www.hyperarts.com/pynchon/gravity/alpha/x-z.html#zero">
zero</a>. He is the cosmic cipher, the unmarshalable, archetypal
square peg, the existential everyman, nonpartisan, nonaligned and
&lsquo;wild,&rsquo; as the poker term has it, all over the place, at
home everywhere and nowhere. The divine bum.&rdquo;

<!-- With all his worldly possessions in one small pack, the Fool travels -->
<!-- he knows not where. So filled with visions and daydreams is he, that -->
<!-- he doesn't see the cliff he is likely to fall over. At his heel, a -->
<!-- small dog harries him (or tries to warn him of a possible mis-step). -->

style="font-variant: small-caps;">Slothrop</a> is an automated
equational theorem prover that performs a variant of Knuth-Bendix <a
href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Bendix_completion_algorithm">
completion</a>. Instead of requiring an <i>a priori</i> term ordering
to ensure convergence of <a href="http://rewriting.loria.fr/"
>rewriting</a>, the space of orderings is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2A_search" >searched</a>. A <a
href="http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/AProVE/">termination
checker</a> is used to restrict search to the well-orderings. Input is
given in <a href="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/" >TPTP</a> format. A
